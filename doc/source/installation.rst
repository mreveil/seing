INSTALLATION 
==============


Installing SEING is meant to be easy and straighforward.


SEING is built with minimal requirements and can be easily compiled with any C/C++ compiler. A generic Makefile is provided in src folder. As a starting point, you can just type.
::
   cd src
   make seing


If this doesn't work, changes might be necessary to adapt the makefile to your operating system and/or environment.
